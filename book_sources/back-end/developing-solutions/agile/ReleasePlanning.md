# 發布規劃

## 概念

### 產生發布規劃

- 發佈計畫是由一個或多個迭代(Iteration)所組成。
- 發佈計畫必須在專案時程及系統功能間取得平衡。
- 迭代計畫是將User Story選入迭代中。
- 客戶代表及開發團隊均應參與制定發佈計畫及迭代計畫。
- 在開始規劃前，必須估算User Story大小並按其重要性加以排序。

### 範例1

1. 撰寫user story（客戶寫）
2. 估算大小（費波納係數）
3. 排定優先順序（客戶排）

### 範例2（依上例放進迭代）

1. 決定估算速度
2. 將user story挑到迭代當中(I可拆解為Y及Z)

### Release Planning

- Release planning is the process of creating a **very high-level plan** that covers a period longer than an iteration.
- First, it helps the product owner and the whole team decide **how much** must be developed and **how long** that will take before they have a releasable product.
- Second, a release conveys expectations about what is likely to be developed and in what time frame.
- Third, a release plan serves as a guidepost toward which the project team can progress.

### The Release Plan

- In some cases we **start with a date** and see how much can be finished by then. In other cases we **start with a set of user stories** and see how long it will take to develop them.
- At a cursory level, determining how much work will fit into a release and what user stories that will be is a very straightforward process.
- During release planning we do not want to create a plan that indicates which developers will work on which user stories or tasks or the sequence in which work will be performed within an iteration.

### 決定滿足條件

- Before starting to plan a release, it is important to know the criteria by which the project will be evaluated as a success or a failure.
- For most projects, the ultimate scorecard is the amount of money saved or generated.
- As leading indicators of whether a project is likely to achieve these financial goals, most projects use the triumvirate of schedule, scope, and resources.
- Many project are either date-driven or feature-driven. A date-driven project is one that must be released by a certain date but for which the feature set is negotiable. A feature-driven is one that we would probably like to release as soon as possible but consider the completion of a set of features more important.
